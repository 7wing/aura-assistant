🌌 **Aura Assistant**

Aura Assistant is a fast, elegant AI chat interface designed to feel intuitive, expressive and frictionless. Built as a full-stack showcase, it merges responsive UI, smart session logic and real-time AI interaction into a single-page experience that feels alive.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack development, including API integration, state management, secure Markdown rendering and responsive, session-aware UI design.

🧰 **Tech Stack**

*Frontend*

HTML5 & CSS3: For the application structure and styling, including a modern, clean design and responsive layouts.

JavaScript (ES6+): Manages all client-side logic, including DOM manipulation, API calls and local storage management. The code is well-structured into logical sections for navigation, history, chat rendering and generation.

marked.js + DOMPurify: These libraries are used together to securely handle the AI's output. marked.js converts the Markdown text into HTML, while DOMPurify sanitizes the resulting HTML, removing any potentially malicious code or scripts and preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Boxicons: Lightweight icon library for UI clarity.

*Backend*

Serverless Node.js API: Handles prompt requests in a scalable environment.

Google Generative AI SDK: The core library for interacting with the Gemini API to process prompts and generate responses.
